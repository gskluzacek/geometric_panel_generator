# geometric_panel_generator

This repo will consist of multiple python modules. Each module will be able to generate the dimensions to form the panels of a specifice geometric polyhedron. The panels generated will include "tabs" that can be used to glue/tape the panels together.

## list of modules:
* dodecagon.py
* geodesci_sphere_v2.py
* **more to come**
